# Car Insurance Claims

Write a program in vanilla JS that reads car insurance claims data from a database asynchronously, and calculates the total amount paid out for each type of claim (such as collision, theft, or liability). Then, log the list of claim types and their total payout amounts to the console.

## Instructions

1. You have been given a json file to simulate the database `insurance.json`
2. Fetch all the data from the file
3. `console.log` all the claim types and their total payout.
